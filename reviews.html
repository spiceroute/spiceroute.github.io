          <blockquote>It was my little one's first birthday, and we had planned for a small celebration with close friends. When I found out about Archana's business, I immediately knew that this was how I could give the birthday party a very personal touch. Since I didn't want a store bought generic cake, I asked Archana for options. She worked with me to figure out what were Amia's favorite things and what I wanted the cake to be. I can only say that the cake brought the party together. It was a layered vanilla with strawberry cheesecake frosting, with flowers, butterflies and strawberries in an elegant bouquet on fondant frosting. It was delicious, and pretty! Thanks a ton for making our special day memorable!!<span>~Manasi Shukla-Kher</span></blockquote>

          <blockquote>I ordered a cake for my daughter's Sweet 16. The cake was moist and delicious!!! The hardest part was cutting the cake as she had made a one of a kind "fairy tale book" cake, perfect for my avid reader! It was so perfect and exceeded my expectations!!!!<span>~Shuba Sriram</span></blockquote>

          <blockquote>The Gulab Jamun cupcake might just be my favorite cupcake of all time! I love Archana's attention to detail and the way she experiments with flavors and textures. She is also very accomodating on dietary restrictions and with her adaptations you could never tell the difference. Her eggless cakes alwayds hit the spot- moist, flavorful and just the right amount of sweetness.<span>~Sandhya Krishnan</span></blockquote>
